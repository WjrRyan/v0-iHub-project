# Internal Community Skeleton

This folder contains a minimal Next.js project that serves as the starting point for a company internal community.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Before running the `lint` script or starting the dev server, ensure all
dependencies are installed with `pnpm install`.

The project includes basic pages for the home screen, login, and profile.
